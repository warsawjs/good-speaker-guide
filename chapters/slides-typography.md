# Typography on Slides

## Font

* Size: **21px** and larger
* Fonts that look good on slides:
    + `Six caps` & `Lato`
    + `Raleway` & `Lobster`
    + `Bauhaus`
    + `Caviar dreams`

!> **WARNING:** A font that is readable on a computer monitor may not be
readable on a projector screen!

## Text and Background Color

Slides will be displayed using a projector. The lamp in it is not always
strong enough for all colors to be visible. Therefore, it's worth maintaining
proper contrast between text and background.

* Well-visible color combinations:
    + black — white
* Poorly visible colors:
    + yellow — gray

To finally verify colors, it's best to use the tool:

## Source Code Presentation

* Enable syntax highlighting
* No need to number lines
* Show code on the full screen
    + It's better to stretch the code to full width
    + The default code display area in popular slide-building frameworks is
        too small
* Code on a light background (**light theme**) is much more visible from the
    audience than code on a dark background (**dark theme**)

### ⚠️ Risky Code Snippet Presentation Formats

Using the following services is highly risky for showing source code due to
the default appearance, which doesn't have high contrast.

* <https://github.com/>
* <https://gist.github.com/>
* <https://carbon.now.sh/>

Code looks good on slides running on a computer or in conditions ensuring
high contrast of the image displayed via projector, e.g., strong lamp, large
screen, no light falling on the screen.

## Animations

* Animations look bad on weaker computers
    + If you don't know what computer you'll be presenting from, save yourself
        the stress and disable animations
* Long animations distract listeners from actual content
    + If you want to use animations, make sure they're short, e.g., up to 200ms
