## Images and Photos

**When selecting images, prioritize diversity, inclusivity, and accessibility:**

* **Diverse representation** — choose images that show people of different
    genders, races, ages, abilities, and body types
* **Avoid stereotypes** — don't reinforce harmful stereotypes through imagery
* **Check licenses** — ensure you have rights to use images; credit creators
    when required
* **Provide alt text** — add descriptive text for screen readers
* **Cultural sensitivity** — ensure images are appropriate across cultures

## Icons and Graphics

**Icons should be clear, recognizable, and universally understood:**

* **Use standard icons** — leverage familiar symbols that work across cultures
* **Combine with text labels** — don't rely on icons alone to convey meaning
* **Ensure sufficient size** — icons should be large enough to see clearly
* **Check cultural meaning** — some symbols have different meanings in
    different cultures

## Animated GIFs

**Use GIFs sparingly and with caution:**

!> **ACCESSIBILITY WARNING:** Animated GIFs can cause problems for people with
vestibular disorders, ADHD, or photosensitive epilepsy. Use with extreme
caution and follow these guidelines:

* **Limit animation duration** — short loops only (2-5 seconds)
* **Avoid rapid motion** — no fast movements or quick flashing
* **Provide controls** — allow people to pause or stop animations if possible
* **Don't auto-play continuously** — have GIFs play once or a limited number of
    times
* **Never flash rapidly** — no content that flashes more than 3 times per
    second
* **Use as accent only** — not for conveying critical information

## Fonts and Typography

**Choose fonts that are accessible and professionally licensed:**

## Charts and Data Visualization

**Make data visualizations accessible and clear:**

* **Use patterns with color** — don't rely on color alone to distinguish data
* **Label directly on chart** — don't make people match legend to data
* **Use high contrast** — ensure all elements are clearly visible
* **Simplify** — remove unnecessary elements; focus on key message
* **Provide alternative text** — describe what the chart shows
* **Use accessible colors** — consider colorblind-friendly palettes

### Colorblind-Friendly Palettes

* Use tools like ColorBrewer to select accessible color schemes
* Combine colors with patterns (dots, stripes, hatching)
* Use distinct shapes for different data series
* Add text labels directly on data points
