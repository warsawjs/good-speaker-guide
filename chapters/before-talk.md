# Preparing for a Talk

## Practice Your Presentation

Practice helps you determine timing and improve delivery:

* **At work** — present to your team for technical feedback
* **At home** — practice in front of a mirror to observe body language
* **With others** — present to someone who can provide constructive feedback
* **Record yourself** — watch the recording to identify areas for improvement

## Prepare Materials in Advance

* **Share slides early** — provide materials to organizers at least 48 hours
    before the event for participants with accessibility needs, interpreters,
    and captioners
* **Test accessibility** — verify slides work with screen readers and have
    proper alt text for images
* **Prepare handouts** — consider providing detailed notes for complex topics
* **Check content** — ensure no inappropriate sexual language, imagery, or
    offensive material in any slides or examples

## Venue and Equipment Preparation

Arrive **at least 30 minutes before** the event starts:

* **Test your equipment** — verify your computer, connectors, and adapters work
* **Check display compatibility** — ensure slides display correctly on the
    venue's screen with proper colors and contrast
* **Test audio/video** — if using multimedia, verify sound works and captions
    are enabled
* **Verify microphone** — test the microphone and learn how to use it properly
* **Check accessibility** — ensure the podium/stage is accessible; request
    adjustments if needed
* **Plan for backups** — have slides available on multiple devices or cloud
    storage

## Review Your Content

* **Avoid assumptions** — don't assume technical level, background, or
    experience of attendees
* **Use inclusive language** — avoid gendered terms like "guys", "dude", or
    "ladies and gentlemen"; use "everyone", "folks", "participants", "team"
* **Check examples** — ensure code examples and scenarios don't perpetuate
    stereotypes or bias
* **Verify accessibility** — confirm all visual content has verbal descriptions
    planned
* **Remove jargon** — define technical terms or provide context for acronyms
* **Respect time** — practice to ensure you stay within allocated time,
    respecting other speakers and attendees

## Mental and Physical Preparation

* **Get adequate rest** — being well-rested helps with clarity and reduces
    anxiety
* **Prepare water** — have still water available (carbonated drinks can cause
    burping)
* **Plan comfort breaks** — know where facilities are located
* **Review code of conduct** — familiarize yourself with the event's code of
    conduct and reporting procedures
