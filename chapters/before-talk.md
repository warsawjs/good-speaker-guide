# Preparing for a Talk

* Practice your speech — this also helps determine how long your presentation
    will take:
    + **At work** — in front of your team
    + **At home** — in front of a mirror
    + **Anywhere** — in front of another person who can provide you with
        feedback
* Arrive before the event starts:
    + Check your computer if you'll be using it during your talk
    + Check that the slides look good on the computer where they will be
        displayed
