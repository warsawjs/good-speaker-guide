# Slide Building Tips

## Accessibility and Inclusivity First

!> **REMEMBER:** Slides are only a support for the presentation. They must be
accessible to all audience members, including those with visual, auditory,
cognitive, or other disabilities.

### Content Guidelines - Code of Conduct Compliance

* **No sexual language or imagery** — this violates the Berlin Code of Conduct
    and is inappropriate for any conference venue
* **No offensive content** — avoid imagery or language that could be considered
    harassing, discriminatory, or demeaning
* **Use diverse representation** — when using photos of people, ensure diversity
    in gender, race, age, and ability
* **Avoid stereotypes** — don't use examples or imagery that perpetuate harmful
    stereotypes
* **Check cultural sensitivity** — ensure content is appropriate across cultures
    and doesn't assume specific cultural knowledge

### Visual Accessibility

* **Provide alternative text** — add alt text to all images for screen readers
* **Use sufficient contrast** — ensure text is readable against background
    (minimum 4.5:1 ratio for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
* **Don't rely on color alone** — use patterns, labels, or text in addition to
    color to convey information
* **Make text large enough** — minimum 24pt for body text, 36pt+ for headings
* **Use clear fonts** — choose fonts designed for readability, not decorative
    fonts
* **Avoid walls of text** — if you must show a lot of text, reveal it line by
    line or break it into multiple slides

### Animation and Motion

* **Avoid flashing or blinking** — content that flashes more than 3 times per
    second can trigger seizures
* **Limit animations** — excessive movement can be distracting for people with
    cognitive disabilities
* **Keep transitions simple** — use fade or cut rather than complex transitions
* **Allow time to read** — keep slides displayed long enough for everyone to
    read the content

## Slide Organization

### Links and Resources

* **Include a resources slide** — share links used during the talk
* **Make it accessible early** — don't wait until the end; consider sharing
    links at the start
* **Use QR codes** — provide QR codes alongside URLs for easy mobile access
* **Use short URLs** — long URLs are hard to type; use a URL shortener or
    memorable custom URLs

### Interactive Elements

* **Design inclusive quizzes** — frame questions so everyone can participate
    regardless of background
* **Allow thinking time** — give people sufficient time to formulate answers
* **Offer multiple participation methods** — not everyone is comfortable with
    public participation
* **Make questions accessible** — ensure quiz slides follow the same
    accessibility guidelines

### Social Media Friendly

* **Create shareable slides** — design some slides specifically for social
    media sharing
* **Use large, bold text** — makes slides readable in photos
* **Include event hashtag** — help people find and share content from the event
* **Add your contact info** — make it easy for people to credit you and
    follow up

## Language and Communication

### Inclusive Language

* **Avoid gendered terms** — don't use "guys", "dude", "ladies and gentlemen"
* **Use "you" or "we"** — creates connection without assumptions
* **Avoid ableist language** — don't use terms like "crazy", "insane", "lame",
    "blind to"
* **Use person-first language** — "person with a disability" not "disabled
    person" (unless the community prefers identity-first)

### Technical Clarity

* **Define acronyms** — spell out abbreviations on first use
* **Explain jargon** — provide context for technical terms
* **Avoid assumptions** — don't assume everyone knows basic concepts of your
    topic
* **Provide context** — explain why something matters, not just what it is

## Examples and Demos

### Diverse and Inclusive Examples

* **Use varied names** — include names from different cultures and backgrounds
* **Vary pronouns** — use a mix of he/him, she/her, they/them in examples
* **Avoid stereotypical scenarios** — don't reinforce biases through example
    choices
* **Use realistic contexts** — make examples relatable to diverse experiences
* **Credit sources** — acknowledge where examples come from, especially from
    underrepresented voices

### Code Examples

* **Use readable syntax highlighting** — ensure color choices work for
    colorblind users
* **Keep examples short** — show only relevant code, not entire files
* **Explain what code does** — verbally describe the code's purpose and
    functionality
* **Provide context** — explain why this code matters or what problem it solves

## Slide Examples

### Effective Slide Design

* Circle in a circle with horizontal lines on both sides (similar to crosshairs)
    — creates visual interest while maintaining simplicity

* **Key slide characteristics:**
    + High contrast for readability
    + Clear focal point
    + Minimal text
    + Professional appearance
    + Culturally neutral imagery
