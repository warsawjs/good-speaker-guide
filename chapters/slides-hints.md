# Slide Building Tips

* Prepare a screen with links that were used during the talk
    + It doesn't have to be the last slide
* Wall-of-text style slides are neither effective nor impressive
    + If we need to show a lot of text, show it line by line
* Create several quiz slides
    + This will stimulate listeners to answer questions
* Create several slides with large fonts
    + Listeners can take photos to publish on social media

!> **REMEMBER:** Slides are only a support for the presentation.

## Slide Examples

* Circle in a circle with horizontal lines on both sides (similar to crosshairs)
