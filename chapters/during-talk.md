# Guidelines During a Talk

## Don'ts

* Lean — this doesn't positively affect reception, it signals boredom
* Turn your back to the audience — this is considered a stage mistake
* Keep hands in pockets — this is a sign of disrespect to the audience

## Best Practices

* Repeat a participant's question that wasn't said into the microphone
* Drink still water, as carbonated drinks can cause burping

## Tips for the Course of a Talk

* During the talk, it's worth asking questions and giving away prizes
* A good talk is telling a story or anecdote
    + The moment of reflection is important
* It's worth telling why the chosen topic interests you

## How to Create an Interesting Talk

Presentations are more interesting when, instead of typical tool or
documentation descriptions, they:

* Describe real **problem solutions**
* Tell any story, i.e., **from real life**
* Explain how they (the tools) **work at their core**
