# Guidelines During a Talk

## Respectful Behavior - Code of Conduct Alignment

### Don'ts - Unacceptable Behaviors

* **Never lean or slouch** — maintains professional presence and shows respect
    for the audience
* **Don't turn your back to the audience** — this is a stage mistake and
    creates accessibility barriers for lip-readers
* **Keep hands visible, not in pockets** — shows engagement and respect
* **Never use sexual language or imagery** — this violates the Berlin Code of
    Conduct and creates an unsafe environment
* **Avoid offensive jokes or stereotypes** — humor should never target
    protected characteristics (gender, race, religion, disability, sexual
    orientation, etc.)
* **Don't use gendered terms** — avoid "guys", "dude", "ladies and gentlemen"
* **Never make assumptions** — don't assume everyone has the same background,
    experience level, or access to resources
* **Avoid belittling language** — never say "this is easy", "obviously",
    "everyone knows", or "well actually"
* **Don't point out individuals** — avoid singling people out in potentially
    embarrassing ways

### Positive Practices

* **Use inclusive language** — address the audience as "everyone", "folks",
    "participants", "team members"
* **Repeat questions clearly** — always repeat audience questions into the
    microphone for those who can't hear and for recordings
* **Provide context** — when someone asks a question, acknowledge it
    respectfully before answering
* **Drink still water** — carbonated beverages can cause burping during
    presentations
* **Pace yourself** — speak clearly and at a moderate pace for understanding
    and accessibility
* **Face the audience** — maintain eye contact with different sections of the
    room
* **Describe visual content** — verbally describe what's on slides, images,
    diagrams, and demos for visually impaired attendees

## Accessibility During Presentation

### Visual Content

* **Describe all slides verbally** — say everything that appears on screen
* **Describe images and diagrams** — explain charts, graphs, screenshots, and
    visual elements
* **Describe live demos** — narrate what you're doing: "Now I'm clicking the
    blue button in the top right corner"
* **Describe gestures** — if asking for raised hands, say "I see about half the
    room has hands up"
* **Read code aloud** — when showing code, read the important parts or describe
    what it does

### Timing and Pacing

* **Respect allocated time** — ending on time shows respect for attendees and
    other speakers
* **Provide breaks** — for talks over 45 minutes, include short breaks
* **Allow processing time** — pause after complex concepts to let people
    process information
* **Watch for comprehension** — look for confused faces and offer to clarify

## Engaging Your Audience Respectfully

### Interactive Elements

* **Ask inclusive questions** — frame questions so everyone can participate
    regardless of background
* **Offer multiple participation methods** — not everyone is comfortable
    speaking publicly; consider written questions
* **Distribute prizes fairly** — if giving swag, have an equitable distribution
    method
* **Welcome all questions** — create a safe space for questions without
    judgment
* **Never mock questions** — every question is valid; treat all with respect

### Storytelling and Examples

* **Share personal experiences** — authenticity creates connection
* **Use diverse examples** — ensure examples represent diverse people and
    scenarios
* **Focus on problems and solutions** — share real challenges and how you
    addressed them
* **Explain fundamentals** — help people understand how tools work at their
    core
* **Relate to real-world impact** — connect technical concepts to practical
    applications

## Creating an Inclusive Environment

### Language and Communication

* **Use gender-neutral pronouns** — use "they/them" when gender is unknown
* **Avoid idioms and regional expressions** — they may not translate well for
    international audiences
* **Define acronyms** — always define abbreviations on first use
* **Provide context** — don't assume shared cultural or technical knowledge
* **Welcome correction** — if you make a mistake, acknowledge it gracefully and
    correct it

### Handling Difficult Situations

* **Address disruptive behavior calmly** — if someone violates the code of
    conduct, alert organizers immediately
* **Support affected individuals** — if harassment occurs, prioritize the
    safety of those affected
* **Don't engage trolls** — defer to organizers and security for handling
    inappropriate behavior
* **Stay professional** — maintain composure even when challenged
* **Know reporting procedures** — understand how to report code of conduct
    violations at the event

## After Your Talk

* **Thank the audience** — express genuine appreciation for their time and
    attention
* **Stay available for questions** — make yourself accessible for follow-up
    conversations
* **Provide contact information** — share ways people can reach you (email,
    social media)
* **Share resources** — provide links to slides, code repositories, and
    additional reading
* **Request feedback** — ask for constructive feedback to improve future
    presentations
