# good-speaker-guide

📘 A handbook for good speakers.

## About the Project

This handbook was created for people who want to develop their presentation
skills, especially in the context of technical talks. It contains practical
tips on preparing slides, preparing for presentations, and guidelines during
talks.

This guide follows the principles of the **Berlin Code of Conduct**, promoting
inclusive, accessible, and respectful presentations that welcome everyone
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic
status, or religion.

## Code of Conduct Commitment

All speakers using this guide are expected to:

- Create a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all participants
- Use inclusive language and avoid assumptions about audience members
- Make presentations accessible to people with diverse abilities
- Refrain from any form of harassment, discrimination, or demeaning behavior
- Respect the dignity and contributions of all community members
